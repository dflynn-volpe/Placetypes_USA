<h3>Area Type</h3>
<hr/>
<p>Area type describes the spatial relationship of places to the urban center. There are 4 area types. These are based on one of the dimensions of the place type system developed in the SHRP 2 S2-C16-RR-1 Report (Effect of Smart Growth on Travel Demand).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Regional Center: Places within urbanized areas that have high levels of population accessibility to jobs and developed at densities and having transportation networks that would allow a substantial portion of the population to get to jobs or other activities by non-auto transport modes.</li>
  <li>Close In Community: Places within urbanized areas and other urban areas that are located near regional centers or are places with relatively high levels of population accessibility to jobs within urban areas that are not urbanized.</li>
  <li>Suburb/Town: Places in urbanized areas, smaller urban areas, and towns that have lower population accessibility to jobs.</li>
  <li>Low Density/Rural: Low density places with low job accessibiity located primarily in rural areas, but may occassionally be found in large vacant tracts in urbanized areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Area types are determined based on the combination of population accessibility to jobs, population density, and transportation network design. Categorical measures are created from continous measures by setting the lower bound for each level (except for the very low level). Following are descriptions of how each of the categorical measures are created and what continuous measures are used to create them:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Regional Access Level: This is a measure of the accessibility of population to jobs. An accessibility measure is created by calculating the harmonic mean of the number of jobs within a defined radius and the population within a defined radius: ACCESS = (2 * JOBS * POP) / (JOBS + POP) where JOBS is the employment within the defined radius and POP is the population within the defined radius. The results divided by 10,000 to establish a more manageable scale for the measure. The user can determine the employment variable to be used with the "Jobs Access Variable" selector. The variables in the choice set were calculated by summing the Smart Location Database (SLD) EMPTOT variable for different distances (in miles) from each block group centroid. The summation distances are included in the varable names following the underscore in the name. For example, in the case of the EMPTOT_2 variable, employment is summed over a 2-mile radius of the block group centroid. The user can determine the population variable using the "Population Access Variable" selector. The variables in the choice set were calculated in the same way that the employment variables were calculated except that the POPTOT10 variable in the SLD was summed. The user establishes the breakpoint values for the categorical jobs access variable using the "Low", "Medium", and "High" numeric selection widgets in the "Regional Access Levels" group.</li>
  <li>Density Level: This is a measure of the density of activity in the block group based on the SLD "D1D" variable which is the "gross activity density (employment + HUs) on unprotected land" (per acre) for the block group. The user establishes the breakpoint values for the categorical density variable using the "Low", "Medium", and "High" numeric selection widgets in the "Density Levels" group.</li>
  <li>Design Level: This is a measure of the suitability of the design of the transportation network for walking, bicycling, and travel by public transportation. It is based on two measures from the SLD that are identified as "Design1" and "Design 2" in the interface. The Design1 variable is based on the SLD "D3amm" variable which is the "network density in terms of multimodal links per square mile". The Design2 variable is based on the SLD "D3apo" variable which is the "network density in terms of facility miles of pedestrian-oriented links per square mile". The "Low", "Medium",and "High" numeric selection widgets in the respective groups are used to set breakpoint values for the categorical variables. The final design categorical variable which is used in creating area types is created by combining the Design1 and Design2 categorical variables. The value of the final categorical variable is the maximum value of the two. For example, if the Design1 value is low and Design2 value is medium, the value of the design categorical variable would be medium.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rules are used to designate area types using the ACCESS, DENSITY, and DESIGN categorical variables as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Regional Center: if ACCESS is high, and DENSITY is medium or high, and DESIGN is high</li>
  <li>Close In Community: if ACCESS is high, and DENSITY is medium or high, but DESIGN is not high</li>
  <li>Close In Community: if ACCESS is high and DENSITY is low</li>
  <li>Close In Community: if ACCESS is medium and DENSITY is medium or high</li>
  <li>Suburb/Town: if ACCESS is high but DENSITY is very low</li>
  <li>Suburb/Town: if ACCESS is very low or low and DENSITY is not very low</li>
  <li>Low Density/Rural: in all other cases</li>
</ul>
