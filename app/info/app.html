<h3>Place Type Application</h3>
<hr/>
<p>This application is a tool for developing and viewing place type designations at the Census block group level for the United States using data from the EPA's Smart Location Database. Place types are categories of land uses that are useful for describing development patterns and their relationship to human behavior (e.g. travel behavior) and well being (e.g. health).  There are many ways that place types may be categorized. This application establishes categories over the following 3 dimensions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Location Type: categorizes the the general urban context of the place (e.g. large urbanized area, small city, etc.).</li>
  <li>Area Type: categorizes the spatial relationship of urban places to the urban center (e.g. urban center, suburbs, etc.). </li>
  <li>Development Type: categorizes the general character of land uses occupying the place (e.g. residential, employment, mixed, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Type categories for each of these dimensions are established in a two-step process. In the first step, categorical variables are established for dimensions (e.g. population density, land use diversity, etc.) relevant to the type category. Each place is given a value of very low (VL), low (L), medium (M), or high (H) for each of these categorical variables. In the second step, a series of rules is applied to designate types based on various combinations of the categorical variable levels. Information on how this is done for each of the type dimensions is explained in the corresponding "... Info" tabs on the right side of the interface. The "Map" tab maps the values of the categorical variables and the resulting types (Location, Area, Development). The value for each Census block group is shown by a colored dot located at the center of block group. The "Summary Statistics" tab shows summary statistics about key variables used to create the development types and outputs calculated by the app.</p>
<p>The widgets at the left side of the interface are used to control what information is displayed and the parameter values for establishing categorical values. Following are descriptions of the widgets and what they do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Select State: This widget is used to select which state is viewed. Calculations are performed for all block groups in the United States, but the results are only shown for the selected state. This is done because the process of mapping the results is relatively slow. Note that when viewing a state with a large population, like California or New York, there can be a significant delay in seeing the results of changing parameters because of the mapping speed.</li>
  <li>Information to Map: This widget is used to identify which information is shown on the map. The user can view the 3 type dimensions as well as each of the categorical variables.</li>
  <li>Choose Place Type Component to Edit: This widget is used to select which type dimension parameters to display. Changing the selection changes the widgets that are displayed below. The meanings of each of these widgets are explained in the corresponding "... Info" tabs.</li>
  <li>Calculate button: Click on this button to calculate and display results of changes to parameters.</li>
  <li>Undo button: Click on this button to return all parameters to the values they had just before the last time the "Calculate" button was clicked. Clicking on the button also recalculates all variables and types and updates the map.</li>
  <li>Restore button: Click on this button to return all parameters to the values they had when the application was started. Clicking on the button also recalculates all variables and types and updates the map.</li>
  <li>Save button: Saves the dataset with all the calculations and also saves the corresponding parameter values. Both are saved as binary R files in the "outputs" directory. The dataset with the data values for all the block groups is named "PlaceType.Rda". The parameter values file is named "Inputs_ls.Rda".</li>
</ul>
