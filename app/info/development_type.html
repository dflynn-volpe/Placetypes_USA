<h3>Development Type</h3>
<hr/>
<p>Development Type categorizes the general character of land uses occupying the place. For example whether the character is predominantly residential, employment, mixed-use, transit-oriented development, etc. These are based on one of the dimensions of the place type system developed in the SHRP 2 S2-C16-RR-1 Report (Effect of Smart Growth on Travel Demand). The system was modified to add a "mixed-high" type which combines mixed uses with relatively high densities but doesn't have enough transit service to qualify as a transit-oriented development. The categories are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Low Density/Rural: These are places that have very low density development in urban or rural areas. In urban areas these can include large tracts of park land or greenfields. In rural areas these include farmlands, forest lands, and open space with or without a scattering of other development.</li>
  <li>Employment: These are places where there are more jobs than households and do not qualify as mixed-use as described below.</li>
  <li>Residential: These are places where there are more households than jobs and do not qualify as mixed-use as described below.</li>
  <li>Mixed: These are places where there are a mixture of jobs and households that meet a specified ratio of the two uses.</li>
  <li>Mixed High: These are places that are mixed and have relatively high densities.</li>
  <li>Transit-Oriented Development (TOD): These are places that are mixed, have relatively high densities, and have relatively high levels of public transit service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Development types are determined based on the combination of the ratio of jobs to households, the density of activities, the level of transit service, and the design of the transportation network. Categorical measures are created from continous measures by setting the lower bound for each level (except for the very low level). Following are descriptions of how each of the categorical measures are created and what continuous measures are used to create them:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Diversity Level: This is a measure of the mixing of jobs and households in the block group. It is based on two measures that are denoted as "Diversity1" and "Diversity2" in the interface. The Diversity1 measure is based on the SLD "D2A_JPHH" variable which is the ratio of jobs to households in the block group. The Diversity2 measure is the ratio of retail and service jobs to the number of households. It is calculated from the SLD "E5_RET10" variable (retail jobs), "E5_SVC10" variable (service jobs), and "HH" variable (households). This second diversity measure is used to capture urban core areas where employment may dominate, but that are still mixed because there are enough retail and service businesses to enable residents to meet most of their daily needs in the immediate area of where the live. The interface for setting threshold levels for establishing categories for the Diversity1 and Diversity2 variables is different than for the other variables because these variables are ratios. For example, there could be the same amount of diversity if the Diversity1 measure is 2 or 1/2: twice as many jobs as households or twice as many households as jobs. For each level threshold (low, medium, high), minimum and maximum threshold values are established. The ranges must be nesting. This means that the medium range must be within the bounds of the low range and the high range much be within the bounds of the medium range. It is up to the user to assure that this is the case. The application does not check the user's inputs in this respect. The final diversity categorical variable combines the results of the Diversity1 and Diversity2 categorical variables by taking the maximum of the values. However, if the density of the block group is very low, the diversity variable is very low as well.</li>
  <li>Density Level: This is a measure of the density of activity in the block group based on the SLD "D1D" variable which is the "gross activity density (employment + HUs) on unprotected land" (per acre) for the block group. The "Area Type" interface is used to establish thresholds for the levels.</li>
  <li>Transit Level: This is a measure of the level of transit service derived from the SLD "D4c" measure which is the "aggregate frequency of transit service within 0.25 miles of block group boundary per hour during evening peak period." The threshold values for defining categories are established using the "Low", "Medium" and "High" numeric selection widgets in the "Transit Levels" group.</li>
  <li>Design Level: Design Level: This is a measure of the suitability of the design of the transportation network for walking, bicycling, and travel by public transportation. The "Area Type" interface is used to establish thresholds for the levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rules are used to designate development types using the DIVERSITY1, DIVERSITY, DENSITY, TRANSIT, and DESIGN categorical variables as follows. Note that the "Mixed" type is calculated as an intermediate variable and that several other types are calculated using it. Similarly the "Mixed High" type is used to calculate the "TOD" type.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Low Density/Rural: if DENSITY is very low.</li>
  <li>Mixed: if DIVERSITY is high and DENSITY is medium or high and DESIGN is medium or high.</li>
  <li>Employment: if not Mixed and Diversity1 is greater than 1 (i.e. more jobs than households).</li>
  <li>Residential: if not Mixed and Diversity1 is less than 1 (i.e. more households than jobs).</li>
  <li>Mixed High: if Mixed and DENSITY is high and DESIGN is high.</li>
  <li>TOD: if Mixed High and TRANSIT is high.</li>
  <li>TOD: if Employment and TRANSIT is high and DESIGN is high.</li>
</ul>
