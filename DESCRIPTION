Description: This source package includes scripts that use the Environmental
  Protection Agency's (EPA) Smart Location Database to develop place type
  designations at the Census block group level. Place types are categories of
  land uses that are useful for describing development patterns and their
  relationship to human behavior (e.g. travel behavior) and well being
  (e.g. health). There are two sets of scripts in the package. The
  process_sld.R and misc.R scripts in the R directory prepare the SLD and
  related data for use in a Shiny app. The server.R, ui.R, and helper.R scripts
  that are part of the Shiny app are in the app directory. Raw data used in
  creating the SLD-derived datasets are in the inst/extdata directory.
  Processed place type datasets are in the data directory. Data used in the
  Shiny app are in the app directory.
